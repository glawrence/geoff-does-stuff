# Geoff Does Stuff

Git repository for example scripts and files to support [Geoff Does Stuff](https://www.geoffdoesstuff.com/). The aim is to provide more complete examples than the short snipets on the main site. I hope that by providing full examples it is easier for people to use but also easier for me to test.

# Code Formatting

Traditionally I have been more of a spaces than tabs person, however there was an article [1] circulating in July 2019 that highlighted the accessibility issues of spaces. In summary, tabs allow flexibility to help people with different issues. If someone needs very large text on the screen they 1 space per tab works well and reduces horizontal scrolling, others prefer say 8 sapces per tab to help readability and have a very wide monitor. Having pondered on what the correct number of spaces to use should be in my examples, I am going to settle on tabs.
