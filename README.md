# Geoff Does Stuff

Git repository for example scripts and files to support [Geoff Does Stuff](https://www.geoffdoesstuff.com/). The aim is to provide more complete examples than the short snipets on the main site. I hope that by providing full examples it is easier for people to use but also easier for me to test.
