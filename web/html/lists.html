<body>
	<p>This file demonstrates different types of list available in HTML. Sometimes a table actually works better but for when it does not here are some lists.</p>

	<p>With the Ordered and Unordered lists you can use text formatting techniques to highlight the title or key part, for example &lt;strong&gt;Item One&lt;/strong&gt;. It is worth commenting here that the "strong" HTML element is for emphasis and whilst commonly rendered as bold, does not mean bold, if you really want bold then use proper text formatting, which for bold is font-weight in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).</p>

	<h3>The Unordered List</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Item One: This is the full description of the first item.</li>
		<li>A Second Item: As the second item this needs a nice descrption.</li>
		<li>Third item: However this time we need a little description.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The Ordered List</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Item One: This is the full description of the first item.</li>
