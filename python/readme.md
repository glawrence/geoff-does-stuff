# Python
Having used Python for several years, but on and off, I have a habit of forgetting things I have previously learnt. This section of my Git repository is for all things Python.

# Useful Documentation
These should be easy enough to find by searching, but sometimes it is easier to scan a list for what you want.

* [The Python Tutorial — Python 3.x documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) - great introduction and place to get started
* [The Python Standard Library — Python 3.12.0 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) - worth paying attention to "Built-in Functions" and "Built-in Types"
* [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code | peps.python.org](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) - this is a very handy guide on writting Python in the "standard" way, it includes naming conventions
* [PEP 257 – Docstring Conventions | peps.python.org](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) - this builds on the Style Guide and explains how to best document methods, classes and so on
* [Regular Expression HOWTO — Python 3.x documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html) - this page has useful links to the `re` module
