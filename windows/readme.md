## windows-sandbox
Windows Sandbox is an optional feature for Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, Version 1903 or later that allows you to quickly and easily try things out in isolation from your machine. If you open or double click a `.wsb` file Windows Sandbox will launch with that config, and it can be configured to run a script. I have written more about this at [Windows 10 | Geoff Does Stuff](https://www.geoffdoesstuff.com/windows-10).
